# avlTreeLibrary
Implementation of an index system for library books using the AVL binary search trees

When running main.py file, two new random datasets will be created from books.csv. Main.py will import the dependencies, where they are created the necessary classes for the practice. In turn dependencies imports the content of the libraries folder, where the AVL dependencies are saved, trees binaries and binary search trees, among others.
